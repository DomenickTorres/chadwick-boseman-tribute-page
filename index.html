                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwick_Boseman" target = "_blank" id="tribute-link"> Chadwick Aaron Boseman </a> (November 29, 1976 – August 28, 2020) was an American actor. He played<br> several historical figures, such as Jackie Robinson in 42 (2013), James Brown in Get on Up (2014), and<br> Thurgood Marshall in Marshall (2017). His role as the superhero Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic<br> Universe films, including Black Panther (2018), made him an international star, winning him an NAACP<br> Image Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

                Boseman graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995. In his junior year, he wrote his first play,<br> Crossroads, and staged it at the school after a classmate was shot and killed. Boseman attended college<br> at Howard University in Washington, D.C., graduating in 2000 with aBachelor of Fine Arts in directing.<br>  One of his teachers was Phylicia Rashad, who became a mentor. She helped raise funds, notably from her friend<br> and prominent actor Denzel Washington, so that Boseman and some classmates could attend the Oxford<br> Mid-Summer Program of the British American Drama Academy in London, to which they had been accepted.

                <p>According to film critic Owen Gleiberman in Variety, "Boseman was a virtuoso actor who had the rare ability <br>to create a character from the outside in and the inside out and he knew how to fuse with a role, etching it in<br> three dimensions... That's what made him an artist, and a movie star, too. Yet in Black Panther, he also became<br> that rare thing, a culture hero". Similarly, reviewer Richard Brody in The New Yorker finds the originality of<br> Boseman's formidable acting technique in his ability to empathize with the interior lives of his characters and<br> render them on screen as fully and completely belonging to the character. The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw<br> wrote of the actor's "beauty, his grace, his style, his presence... These made up Chadwick Boseman's persona<br> and he became the lost prince of American cinema, glorious and inspirational"</p>
            
                <p>
                Boseman was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, which eventually progressed to stage IV before 2020.<br> He had never spoken publicly about his cancer diagnosis. During treatment, involving multiple surgeries and<br> chemotherapy, he continued to work and completed production for several films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods,<br> Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, and others. Boseman died at his home as a result of complications related to colon<br> cancer on August 28, 2020, with his wife and family by his side.
